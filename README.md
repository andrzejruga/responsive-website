# Appilicous

This is one page layout created from scratch based on Kevin Powell tutorial from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb">YouTube channel</a>.<br>
I made some improvements to the original project, for instance I used SCSS instead of SASS, BEM instead of author's own naming convention and a few other tweaks.<br>
The site is build with Flexbox, with a bit of Grid and jQuery.<br>
It's fully responsive, hopefully with no major problems ;)
